# Gyro-Camera

A camera with orientation, leveraging Web APIs.

## Technical notes

Currently, there are two sets of Web APIs about orientation.

- [**Device orientation events**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Device_orientation_events) and [`DeviceOrientationEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent)

  - Early 2010s standard; [only partially supported (â‰ˆ deprecated)](https://caniuse.com/deviceorientation) in 2020s.

    It precedes the [Permissions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API), and Safari use a nonstandard `requestPermission()` static method to solve the problem.

  - It gives [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles).

- [**Sensor APIs**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Sensor_APIs) and [`RelativeOrientationSensor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RelativeOrientationSensor)

    - Late 2010s standard; [not supported by Firefox and Safari](https://caniuse.com/orientation-sensor) yet.

    - It gives [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion).

This project uses `DeviceOrientationEvent`.

This project was based on [Gyro-web: Accessing the device orientation in JavaScript | Trekhleb](https://trekhleb.dev/blog/2021/gyro-web/) ([0BSD License](https://github.com/trekhleb/trekhleb.github.io/blob/7b151f8ac9024c24b1df818f9308bcaf2d354943/LICENSE)). The Euler angles were interpreted incorrectly in that article, and I fixed it according to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Device_orientation_events/Using_device_orientation_with_3D_transforms#using_orientation_to_rotate_an_element).
